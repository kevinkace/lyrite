Brain invasion goin' on in everyone
You feel the things that make your world turn angry red
Because the next time you can't take it
Next thought murderlation
And hate is all you want to know

Whoa oh oh
Hate breeders
Whoa oh oh
(x4)

Murder one inborn into your every cell
It's in your blood and you can't shake it
Because you were bred to take it
Next stop annihilation
They bred the hate right in your bones

Whoa oh oh

Next stop annihilation
They bred the hate right in your fuckin' bones

Whoa oh oh

Hate is your mistress and you shall not want
You shall not want because your breed is strong
Because when they try to break you
New world desolation
And strength is all you gotta know

Whoa oh oh

And all you know
