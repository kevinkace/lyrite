Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, oh, sing one we know
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
That's what I'll do

I say oh
I say oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, yeah, yes I will)

I say oh
I cry oh

And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
Sing it out

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
