Son of a Gun
Nirvana

---

Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again

Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again

Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

Up, up, up and down
Turn, turn, turn around
Round, round, round about
And over again

Gun, gun, son of a gun
You are the only one
Makes any difference to what I say

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away

The sun shines in the bedroom
When we play
The raining always starts
When you go away
