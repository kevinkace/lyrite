Judy is a Punk
The Ramones

---

Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin, joined the Ice Capades

And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why

Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah

Second verse, same as the first

Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to Berlin, joined the Ice Capades

And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why

Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah

Third verse, different from the first

Jackie is a punk
Judy is a runt
They both went down to San Frisco, joined the SLA

And oh, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know why

Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
Perhaps they'll die, oh yeah
